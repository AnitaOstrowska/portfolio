## ABOUT ME
I'm becoming a tester with great attention to detail and a good understanding of the STLC process. Perceptiveness and inquisitiveness, so important in a tester's job, have always been part of my work.
I enjoy new challenges because I can use them in many different ways. They allow me to expand my knowledge, shape my skills and use my full potential. During testing I always assume that there is something that has not been found so far.
In the near future I would like to become an automated tester.

## EXPERIENCE

**QA / TESTER MENTEE**
, **Dare IT**

Nov 2021 - Feb 2022

Dare IT Mentoring is a 3-month program during which I work with my mentor (Agnieszka Kłosowska - QA Team Leader at mTab Sp. z o.o.) on my QA / Testing skills.

During the program I will also improve my soft skills (such as time management, giving feedback, working in a team), as well as learn about working in Agile and Scrum.
I'm glad that I could take part in such an initiative, because qualifying for the programme was quite an achievement. There were more than a dozen candidates for one place.
